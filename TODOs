TODO cats effect having to use both sync and concurrent - what does this mean
[FE] Doesn't mean anything, there is a hierarchy to these types which can be found here (I do not know it by heart)
https://www.google.com/search?q=cats+hierarchy+scala&rlz=1C5GCEM_enGB1001GB1001&oq=cats+hierarchy+scala&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i390l2.3387j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#imgrc=IPtFKgtDqoTFFM
You can see Sync has all the functionalities that Concurrent provides, so it's fine

I need to look more into this
TODO what is adaptError and how do we want to handle errors here? What are partial functions
[FE] partial functions are functions that are only applied to part of tall the possible inputs you can use. For example
def myMethodTwo: PartialFunction[Int, Int] = {
  case 2 => 5
  case 6 => 3
}

This is equivalent to:
def myMethod(n: Int): Int = n match {
  case 2 => 5
  case 6 => 3
}

But PartialFunction provides a bunch of other functionalities, like chaining and isDefined

AdaptError is just a method to manipulate the Error you get by something you want (Idea here is you want
your errors to be as clear as possible). You can see in the method signature, it takes a function that is Throwable => Throwable

Two ways to handle errors here:
1. We throw the error when at least one of the partners are down or returns an error
2. You return whatever you have a print (or log) the error. So if one of the partner is down, but the other isn't,
it will still return the results for that partner

Which do you want to focus on?

TODO start service with bash script
[FE] Hint: Try and run your app from the terminal and then put that command in the start script. We can improve it from there!

TODO make it easy to add another partner - generics?
[FE] Yes or inheritance or type classes (need to check how that woukd work exactly)
